# FEBioChem

This is the documentation for **FEBioChem**, an FEBio plugin that allows users to solve reaction-diffusion and reaction-diffusion-convection problems in the context of a (non-deformable) mixture with multiple chemical species. The species can be solutes that flow with the solvent, or can be bound to the solid phase of the mixture. In this regard, this plugin offers similar capabilities as the FEBioMix module in FEBio (at least for non-deformable mixtures). However, since the mixture is assumed non-deformable, the calculations are optimized and the performance improved.

Please see the [Tutorial](febiochem_tutorial1.md) page for a practical guide on using the FEBio Chem plugin with FEBio Studio. 

The [User Manual](febiochem_user_manual.md) page describes the features of the plugin in the context of the FEBio Input file. 

For some background on the theory, please see the [Theory](febiochem_theory.md) page.
